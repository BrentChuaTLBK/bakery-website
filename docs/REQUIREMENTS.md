# Requirements and review status

This draft adds ordering to the existing TLB Kitchen static website. It uses the uploaded **Order System Final Draft.docx**, the current conversation, and the implementation contract. The latest instruction makes **Cococart the general workflow reference**; no further reference screenshots are required. Cococart branding is not copied.

The work begins from upstream main `571de6e9fcb51a70bafc1483a0b6fe11752f5198` in a separate checkout/development branch. Existing pages, content, photos, and branding are preserved. The ordering database starts empty and paused. No catalog import/migration is required. Any optional sample experience must be explicitly labelled demo and isolated from the real backend.

**Readiness limit:** a preview without an owner-configured Supabase project, verified email sender, SMTP/API credentials, and running scheduler cannot demonstrate persistent ordering or actual email delivery. Integration code and local technical checks do not substitute for those connected tests. Brent's acceptance testing remains unperformed until he records his results in [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md).

A local clone/development branch is not a GitHub fork. Record the actual fork/branch URL below when it exists. Main and the live website remain unchanged until Brent approves the final result and the respective merge/deployment action.

## Architecture and reused components

The original repository is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website. Its pages, existing assets, original content, and navigation remain the base. New `shop.html`, `account.html`, authentication callback/reset pages, and `manage.html` add customer ordering and staff administration. Shared modules under `assets/ordering/` connect those pages to the backend.

Supabase provides PostgreSQL persistence, email/password authentication, storage, and Edge Functions. Database transactions enforce stock, promo, and status rules. Supabase custom SMTP handles authentication emails; Resend handles transactional delivery through the email worker. The owner creates/enables these services and supplies configuration. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) and [SERVICES.md](SERVICES.md) for current setup, plans, DNS, and secret placement.

All money is stored/calculated as integer centavos and displayed as PHP with two decimals. Business dates/times use Asia/Manila. Fulfillment dates are calendar dates; payment deadlines and audit events are absolute timestamps displayed in Manila.

## Confirmed requirements and implementation defaults

The first column below identifies actual requirements. The defaults are disclosed implementation choices for review; they are not invented TLB Kitchen operating policies.

| Area | Confirmed requirement | Draft implementation default / pending shop data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reference | Existing TLB Kitchen branding; Cococart general ordering workflow | No missing-screenshot dependency; no Cococart branding copy |
| Catalog | Admin creates products; no import | Empty catalog, paused until configured; demo content clearly labelled if offered |
| Lead time | Full production dates between submission and fulfillment; Monday + 1 production day means Wednesday earliest | Order day and fulfillment day excluded; no same-day fulfillment; zero lead means next supported date |
| Cutoff | Configurable; must preserve confirmed lead-time example | Disabled until set; at/after cutoff adds one eligible full production day |
| Schedule | Production schedule distinct from fulfillment booking closures | Owner enters real weekdays, exclusions, blocked dates, and quantities; sample values are test-only |
| Capacity | Per product per date; pickup/delivery share; no flavor or order-count stock | Explicit capacity row required; missing row means unavailable; reduction below held+committed is rejected |
| Delivery | Fixed admin zones, supported-address validation, separate recipient details | Exact structured locality selection plus full address; no automated arbitrary-address geocoding |
| Delivery timing | Date only; window initially 9 AM–6 PM | Configurable text window; no time-slot controls or guaranteed morning arrival |
| Proof | Secure, validated upload plus payment reference; 15-minute deadline | JPEG/PNG/WebP, maximum 5 MB; successful validated commit must occur strictly before deadline; PDF not allowed in this draft |
| Guest access | Unguessable secure access link | Link grants access to its holder; token is not the human-readable order reference and does not expire with the payment deadline |
| Proof viewing | Private | Staff receives a temporary signed URL, draft lifetime five minutes |
| Account tokens | Secure, expiring verification and single-use password reset | Supabase-authenticated flow; configured lifetimes and redirect URLs documented during owner setup |
| Promo math | Percentage/fixed, subtotal-only minimum/discount, saved rules, one code | Integer centavos; percentage value whole percent; server rounding convention must be recorded and tested |
| Unpaid promo requalification | Below-minimum edit releases unused reservation; no duplicate use | Later qualifying edit reacquires one use for the same order under saved rules/original eligibility if allowance remains; otherwise fails without mutation |
| Existing item pricing | Saved prices for unchanged items; current prices for new configurations | Quantity-only edits retain same configuration's saved unit price |
| Archive/hide | Temporarily unavailable/archived products need not be deleted; submitted snapshots survive | `active=false` is the reversible hide/archive control; retained record and snapshots provide history |
| Cancellation stock | Admin decides whether produced/committed units may be restored | Explicit restore-stock choice for the cancelled order; unpaid held units release once |
| Roles | Secure server-enforced admin permissions | Owner manages catalog/settings/promos/roles; staff handles permitted order/stock actions; no public self-elevation |
| Services | Owner activates services/subscriptions; actual emails required for connected draft testing | Supabase and Resend integrations prepared; provider accounts, sender/DNS, secrets, and jobs need owner setup |

## Traceability matrix

**How to read this table:** API/action and page names describe where the implementation is required by `IMPLEMENTATION-CONTRACT.md`. They do not certify that the action passed runtime testing. At handoff, review the corresponding code and record technical evidence above. Each behavior must also be exercised in the connected preview using the named acceptance cases. A setup-blocked behavior stays blocked rather than being marked complete because a button exists.

## Order state contract

Payment and fulfillment are separate fields. Refund is a manually applied/removable label, not a payment or fulfillment state.

| Event | Payment afterward | Fulfillment afterward | Stock / promo | Further proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Successful new submission | Awaiting payment | Pending confirmation | Hold product/date units and eligible promo once | Allowed before deadline |
| Successful timely proof | Under review | Pending confirmation | Keep holds regardless of review delay | Disabled |
| No successful proof within 15 minutes | Awaiting payment | Expired | Release held units and unused promo once | Disabled |
| Admin approves full initial payment | Paid | Confirmed | Convert held units to committed and promo to redeemed; no second deduction | Disabled |
| Admin rejects initial proof | Rejected | Cancelled | Release held units and unused promo once; preserve reason/history | Permanently disabled |
| Admin cancels unpaid order | Existing unpaid status | Cancelled | Release applicable holds once | Disabled |
| Admin cancels paid order | Paid | Cancelled | Explicit quantity restoration choice; redeemed promo stays counted | Disabled |
| Admin edits paid active order | Paid | Preserve existing progress | Apply only affected quantity deltas; recalculate saved discount; retain initial approved payment record | Disabled |

Permitted fulfillment values are Pending confirmation, Confirmed, Preparing, Ready for pickup, Out for delivery, Completed, Cancelled, and Expired. Staff controls fulfillment progress; the date alone never marks readiness, dispatch, or completion.

## External setup and remaining release gates

| Gate | Owner action / evidence needed | Affected behavior until complete |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub fork/write access | Confirm a real fork under an account with write access and preserve main-based development branch | A local completed change cannot be represented as a pushed fork |
| Supabase staging project | Owner creates/selects project; applies migrations/configuration and public client settings | Persistent catalog/settings/orders, authentication, transactional stock/promos |
| Protected first owner | Register/verify account, then perform documented privileged role assignment | Secure admin access |
| Storage / Edge Functions | Configure buckets/policies; deploy functions and private environment secrets | Image upload, private payment proof, signed staff viewing |
| Authentication SMTP | Verify sender domain; configure custom SMTP and auth redirect URLs/token lifetimes | Actual verification/resend/reset emails |
| Transactional email provider | Owner verifies domain/DNS and configures API secret | Actual order/status emails; an outbox entry alone is not delivery |
| Scheduled worker | Configure authenticated periodic invocation, reminder time, and monitoring | Timely automated expiry, due-date reminders, durable email retries |
| Business settings | Owner supplies actual pickup/payment/contact data, schedules, zones/fees/capacities | Correct real business behavior; demo data is not operational configuration |
| Connected preview UAT | Owner runs checklist, records results, resolves failed/blocked cases | No claim of accepted or production-ready ordering |
| Final repository review / approval | Record final diff/commit, fork URL, merge approval and live deployment approval | No main merge or live-site publication |

Do not add loyalty programs, additional promotions, live payment gateways, deposits/installments, extra-payment workflows, refund processing/ledgers, live courier booking/pricing, flavor inventory, shared stock across dates, order-count capacity, or customer time slots without a new request.
