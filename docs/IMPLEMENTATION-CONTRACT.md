# Ordering implementation contract

Draft based on upstream main 571de6e9fcb51a70bafc1483a0b6fe11752f5198. Original static site stays; ordering is additive. Empty catalog by default, no imported products. Optional explicitly labelled demo is separate from real backend. PHP amounts in integer centavos in API/DB, 2 decimals in UI. Asia/Manila dates/times. Supabase Auth + PostgreSQL + Storage + Edge Functions, Resend SMTP/API. No accounts/billing activated by this build.

## File ownership and public client

- Root: `shop.html`, `assets/ordering/shop.js`, `assets/ordering/ordering.css`, original navigation links, integration.
- Backend: `supabase/migrations/*` and SQL tests, schema and all DB/RPC logic.
- Services: `supabase/functions/*`, `supabase/config.toml`, docs/SETUP.md, docs/SERVICES.md, scheduler setup; coordinate SQL helper functions directly with backend agent.
- Admin UI: `manage.html`, `assets/ordering/manage.js`, `assets/ordering/manage.css`.
- Account/client: `account.html`, `auth-callback.html`, `reset-password.html`, `assets/ordering/client.js`, `assets/ordering/account.js`, `assets/ordering/config.js`.
- QA guide agent: docs/ACCEPTANCE.md, docs/REQUIREMENTS.md.

Browser client exports `api(action, payload={}, token=null)`, `auth`, `ready`, `configured`, `money(cents)`, `escapeHtml(value)`, `manilaDate(value?)`, `formatDate(ISOdate)`, `toast(message,type?)`, `upload(file, {kind,order_id,token,payment_reference})`. `auth` is Supabase client.auth or null; `ready` resolves auth initialization. Import Supabase JS from a pinned ESM CDN module only when configured so disconnected preview renders. config.js exports `config={supabaseUrl:'',supabasePublishableKey:''}`. api calls RPC `shop_api` with `p_action, p_payload, p_token`. Throw Error with server message on failures; server returns data directly. Auth session automatically forwarded by Supabase SDK. No service key in browser.

All pages use shared CSS and consistent header logo at assets/img/brands/Hat.png; main shop link shop.html, account account.html, staff manage.html. Body #toast-region live region added by client. Shared CSS classes: page-shell, topbar, brand, nav-links, panel, button, button-secondary, button-quiet, field, field-row, muted, eyebrow, badge, empty-state, notice, danger, success, section-heading, table-wrap, data-table, dialog-actions. Root supplies CSS.

## Product shape

`{id:uuid,name,description,category_id:uuid|null,price_cents:integer,min_quantity:integer,lead_days:integer,active:boolean,photos:string[],option_groups:[],sort_order:integer}`.
Each option group `{id:string,label:string,required_count:integer,choices:[{id:string,label:string,surcharge_cents:integer,active:boolean}]}`. required_count=1 is single choice; >1 uses counted mix summing exactly required_count. Products can have multiple groups. Selection payload maps group ids to choice counts: `{flavour:{classic:4,matcha:2}}`. Surcharges per sellable unit. Only box/product stock, never flavor stock.
Categories `{id,name,sort_order}`.
Inventory `{product_id,date:YYYY-MM-DD,capacity:integer,available:boolean,reserved?:integer,remaining?:integer}`. Every sellable date requires explicit capacity row; missing row means unavailable. Shared pickup/delivery inventory.

## Settings shape

`{shop_name:'The Little Baker Kitchen',paused:true,pause_message,pickup_address,contact_email,contact_phone,payment_instructions,delivery_window:'9:00 AM – 6:00 PM',production_weekdays:[0,1,2,3,4,5,6],nonproduction_dates:[],fulfillment_weekdays:[0,1,2,3,4,5,6],blocked_dates:[],cutoff_time:null,reminder_time:'08:00',reminders_enabled:false,owner_email,site_url}`. Sunday=0. Default paused until owner sets operational details; no fabricated bank details. cutoff disabled by default, if configured submission at/after adds one eligible production day. Lead count dates strictly between submission and fulfillment. No customer time slots. delivery zones `{id,name,localities:[string],fee_cents,active}`; locality is explicit selectable city/barangay combined label, matched exactly server-side.

## API actions

`catalog` payload `{date?}` -> `{products,categories,settings,zones,inventory}`. inventory can cover next 90 days; ignore private settings owner_email. `quote` payload checkout as below -> `{items,subtotal_cents,discount_cents,delivery_cents,total_cents,promo,earliest_date?}`; no reservations at quote. Error stock/date detail actionable; never silently remove/change cart.

Checkout payload `{items:[{product_id,quantity,selections}],fulfillment_date,method:'pickup'|'delivery',buyer:{name,email,phone,social_platform?,social_username?},recipient:{name,phone}?,address:{locality,line1,line2?,postal_code?}?,instructions?,promo_code?,idempotency_key:uuid}`. `create_order` -> order including access_token only for successful submission/retry. Random secure token digest stored for access; privacy policy table prevents unauthorized reads.
`get_order` payload `{order_id}` with token or authenticated owner/admin -> order. `my_orders` -> array of own orders; authenticated email user, not email-only lookup. Guest order does not silently attach just by same email.

Order shape `{id,reference,created_at,fulfillment_date,method,buyer,recipient,address,instructions,items,subtotal_cents,discount_cents,delivery_cents,total_cents,promo_snapshot,payment_status,fulfillment_status,payment_deadline,proof_path,payment_reference,paid_amount_cents,refund_label,revision,history:[],access_token?}`. Item snapshots `{product_id,name,quantity,selections,selection_labels:[],unit_price_cents,line_total_cents}`. Payment statuses awaiting_payment,under_review,paid,rejected. Fulfillment pending_confirmation,confirmed,preparing,ready_for_pickup,out_for_delivery,completed,cancelled,expired. History rows `{at,actor,action,reason,before?,after?}`.

`admin_bootstrap` -> `{role,products,categories,settings,zones,inventory,promos,orders}` (role owner or staff). Staff can order operations/stock, owner also catalog/settings/promos/roles. Server must enforce.
`save_product` payload `{product:<shape>}` -> product; new id absent generate.
`save_category` payload `{category:<shape>}` -> category; `delete_category` payload `{id}` safely clear category refs.
`save_inventory` payload `{rows:[{product_id,date,capacity,available}]}` -> rows. Cannot reduce below held+committed allocations. Mark unavailable does not alter orders.
`save_settings` payload `{settings:<shape>}` -> settings.
`save_zone` payload `{zone:<shape>}` -> zone; deactivate for removal.
Promo `{id,code,kind:'percent'|'fixed',value:integer,min_subtotal_cents:integer,cap_cents:integer|null,per_account_limit:integer,global_limit:integer,expires_at:ISOtimestamp,active:boolean}`; percent value is whole percent (1-100), fixed value centavos.
`save_promo` payload `{promo:<shape>}` -> promo.
`approve_payment` payload `{order_id,revision,idempotency_key}` -> order. Only under_review, one approved initial payment; reserved stock becomes committed, no second subtraction; original approved amount fixed.
`reject_payment` payload `{order_id,revision,reason,idempotency_key}` -> order (Rejected + Cancelled, release all held, permanent proofdisable).
`set_fulfillment` payload `{order_id,revision,status,idempotency_key}` -> order; method-specific allowed progress, only Paid and active, no date autochanges.
`cancel_order` payload `{order_id,revision,reason,restore_stock:boolean,idempotency_key}` -> order. Paid remainsPaid; redeemedpromo not restored; produced quantity returns only explicit true. Unpaid always releases.
`set_refund_label` payload `{order_id,revision,enabled:boolean,reason,idempotency_key}` -> order; updates the label only in storage. Analytics treats an enabled label on a paid order as a full refund: exclude its entire current value, units and fulfillment method from net sales reporting. Manual money transfers, stock, payment/fulfillment states and promo usage are unchanged.
`edit_order` payload `{order_id,revision,reason,idempotency_key,changes:<partial checkout payload plus delivery_cents override>}` -> order. Preserve same config prices (incl qtyonly edits), current price for new config. Bypass lead but validate changed stock/date; contact-only not revalidate. Atomic delta allocations, rollback on failure. Saved promo rules recalculated; original eligibilitytimestamp; paid redemption persists incl zero discount; unpaid below min releases, requalification reacquires one sameorder reservation if capacity. Paid+fulfillmentprogress+originalpaidamount unchanged. Event old/new calculation.
`list_staff` -> array `{user_id,email,role}`; `save_staff` payload `{email,role:'owner'|'staff'|'none'}` only owner; existing verified user needed. Cannot remove final owner. First owner assigned manually via protected SQL after verifying signup, not public setup URL.

## Edge API

`proof-upload` POST multipart file,kind='proof'|'product',order_id,token,payment_reference. Access Authorization supplied session or anon key; proof guest allowed securely, product admin-only. Validate image magic PNG/JPEG/WebP max5MB. Private proof bucket, public product images bucket; random filenames. Validate status both before storage and atomically at proof commit; delete object on race/failure. Returns `{order}` for proof, `{url,path}` for product. Uploaded proof before deadline Under review indefinitely. Token is never URL query to third-party endpoint.
`proof-url` authenticated admin POST `{order_id}` -> `{url}` expiring5min. No public proof URLs.
`email-worker` secret worker token only; expire no-proof holds and queue due reminders (server-side periodic jobs also lazy expiration in order transactions), claim outbox, recheck due date/status, deliver with Resend idempotency keys, durable sent guard, retry backoff. Auth emails by Supabase custom SMTP. Failed configuration/delivery visible to admin (add email status bootstrap as necessary); never report email sent merely because queued.
Services/backend agents coordinate service-only RPC helper signatures, outbox schema and cron. RPC helpers revoked from public except explicitly authorized methods. RLS private tables; public read only via function. Auth.uid()/verified auth.users email checked for promos/owner history/admin.

## Preview

Real integration starts empty and paused. Unconfigured mode must explicitly say backend setup pending and never pretend accounts/emails/orders are persisted. May include optional opt-in demonstration sample data explicitly labelled and isolated, but live catalog has no samples. User activation of external services needed. Preserve original site navigation/content/photos and no deployment to live/main without approval.

## Integration refinements

Actual item `selection_labels` are objects `{group,label,quantity,surcharge_cents}`; render their count and surcharge. Order operational snapshots are flat fields (`payment_instructions`, `pickup_address`, `pickup_hours`, `pickup_instructions`, `delivery_window`, `contact_email`, `contact_phone`). `preview_edit_order` accepts order_id,revision,changes and returns a proposed order with preview:true. Browser `create_order` and operational `edit_order` submit `expected_quote` containing items/subtotal_cents/discount_cents/delivery_cents/total_cents; the DB compares these to current trusted calculations before writing, requiring review again if changed. Closed orders allow audited contact-only corrections; changes to closed order items/date/method remain guarded. `add_staff_note` is private.
